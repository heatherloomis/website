After growing up around the country as an Air Force brat, **Austin** became my chosen home in 2006. For my entire life I have been behind a camera documenting all the things, and I have worked professionally as a photographer for over a decade. 

My photography style is **warm, bright, bohemian, fun**, and **natural**. I will capture the candid moments of your important event beautifully while my extensive background in portrait photography will ensure the details, poses, and expressions of you and your guests are on point.

I will be **responsive** and **clear** in our communication, add some **sparkle** and **ease** to your event, and provide a **quick turnaround** on your images.

In my spare time you can find me at the **gym** lifting weights, on the streets of Austin riding my **bike**, or on one of our **lakes** surfing or paddle boarding. I also enjoy curling up with a good **book** or **video game** at home.
