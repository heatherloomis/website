After growing up in various cities throughout the USA as an Air Force brat, I have chosen Austin as my home for the last 16 years. I cannot remember a time when I have not been behind a camera documenting events and happenstance moments, but on a professional level I have been in the photography industry for over 10 years. 

Beauty can be found in all moments, and I take great pride in capturing that in my photographs. Waiting until a smile is at its brightest, catching the light just right, making the background pop, framing subjects well; those are the things I am striving for to showcase your important event. My background in portrait photography has also given me a strong eye for ensuring details are on point and for gently encouraging more natural and flattering poses and expressions. My style is natural, editorial, fun, and bright.

I am easy to work with and a consummate professional.  I will be responsive and clear in my communication with you, provide a quick turnaround on your images, put you and your guests at ease, and add some sparkle to your event or portrait session.

In my spare time you can find me at the gym lifting weights, on the streets of Austin riding my bike, or on one of our lakes surfing or paddle boarding. I also greatly enjoy curling up with a good book or video game at home.
